Patron registration administration
----------------------------------

Email addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[patrons,email addresses]
indexterm:[email]


It's possible to set up the patron registration form to
either allow or disallow users to enter multiple email
addresses for a single patron, separated by a comma.

To do this, go to Administration -> Local Administration
-> Library Settings Editor.  Search for the setting called
`ui.patron.edit.au.email.regex`.

If you'd like to allow multiple email addresses, set this
value to `^(?:(?:\b[^@,\s]+@[^@,\s]+\.[^@.,\s]+\b)(?:,\s?(?!$)|$))*$`

If you'd like to disallow multiple email addresses, set
this value to `^(?:\b[^@,\s]+@[^@,\s]+\.[^@.,\s]+\b)$`
