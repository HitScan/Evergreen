Copy Alert Permissions Added to Seed Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Copy alerts were improved in recent releases of Evergreen,
but the permissions were not assigned to any of the stock
permission profiles in the "seed data" supplied to first time
installations.  

The VIEW_COPY_ALERT permission is now assigned to all profiles
under the "Staff" parent profile, and ADMIN_COPY_ALERT is now
assigned to Cataloging Administrator and should be available to
all Administrator profiles.

This change does NOT include an upgrade script, so site server
administrators are responsible for updating the permissions
profiles for their individual systems.
