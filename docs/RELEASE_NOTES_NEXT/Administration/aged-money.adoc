Aged Money Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two new global flag settings have been added to control if/when billings and
payments are aged.  Both settings are disabled by default.

* 'history.money.age_with_circs' 
 ** Age billings and payments linked to circulations when the cirulcation 
    is aged.
* 'history.money.retention_age'
  ** Age billings and payments based on the age of the finish date for
     the linked transaction.
  ** To age money based on this setting, there is a new srfsh script
     at (by default) /openils/bin/age_money.srfsh.

The aged payment table now has accepting_usr, cash_drawer, and billing
columns to improve reporting of aged money.
