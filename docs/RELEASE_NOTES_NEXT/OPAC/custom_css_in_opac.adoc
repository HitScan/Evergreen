Custom CSS in OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is now a library setting called opac.patron.custom_css. This can be
populated with CSS that will load in the OPAC after the stylesheets and
allow for custom CSS without editing server side templates. The permission
UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.opac.patron.custom_css manages access to it.
