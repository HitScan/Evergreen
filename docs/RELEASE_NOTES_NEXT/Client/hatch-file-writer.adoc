Hatch File Writer Print Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds a new stock print option in the Hatch printer configuration interface
called Hatch File Writer (translatable).  When selected, any print content
that is delivered to this printer is translated into text where necessary
and written to a file in the Hatch profile directory.

The name of the file written is based on the print context: 
"receipt.<context>.txt".  For example, 'receipt.label.txt'.
