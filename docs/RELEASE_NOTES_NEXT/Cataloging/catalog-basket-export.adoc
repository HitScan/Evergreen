Staff Catalog Basket Export Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds a new "Export Records" option to the staff catalog basket menu.
When selected, the user is directed to the Vandelay record export
interface, which will be set to "basket export" mode.  Staff can then
apply export preferences (usmarc, marxml, etc.) and export the basket
records.  In "basket export" mode, Vandley provides a link to return to
the catalog (preserving search params).
