    LP#1846038 Remove extra grid refresh from configuration load
    
    Bug LP#1790169 added the ability to save sorting configuration, but it
    also added an additional grid refresh to the configuration load.  This
    breaks grid loading.
    
    The expected flow is for is to first load any existing configuration,
    then do the first collect() for the grid.  This refresh() call adds
    potentially a second collect() which may run earlier than it should,
    and overall does not seem necessary.
    
    To test:
    
    (Make sure you are testing on current master or rel_3_3/3_4, or you
    will (like me) hit related bugs which have been fixed.  Also, some
    grids (especially circ) do not honor sort for other reasons, so avoid
    those for now.)
    
    1) Find a grid which has a typical get() process.  Suggestion would be
    a basic auto grid, such as full bill details,
    https://localhost/eg/staff/circ/patron/11/bill/43/details .
    2) Set a sort value you can see, then *save* the configuration.
    3) Before the patch, billing details grid doesn't load.  After patch,
    grid loads and still honors the defined sort.

    Lp 1835620: Require some Storage submodules instead of use them
    
    Switch from "use" to "require" for submodules in OpenILS::Application
    ::Storage::CDBI and OpenILS::Application::Storage::Driver::Pg.
    Circular dependencies and other issues cause the following errors at
    compile time for those modules:
    
    Compilation failed in require at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.28.1/OpenILS/Application/Storage/CDBI.pm line
    9.
    
    Compilation failed in require at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.26.1/OpenILS/Application/Storage/Driver/Pg.pm
    line 15.
    
    Require loads the submodules at run time and does not attempt to
    import any methods.  This is the behavior we want, eliminates the
    above errors, and everything still works.
    
    Add comments above the required modules explaining why require is
    needed and not use.
    
    Enable and reorder all of the tests in Open-ILS/src/perlmods/t/
    09-OpenILS-Application-Storage-Driver.t.  Repairing the above issue
    also repairs these tests.

    LP#1777698 Duplicate barcode alert appearing on new barcodes
    
    When scanning new copy barcodes, ng-change quickly fires multiple times
    and sends promises to check for duplicates. If 1234 exists and you scan
    12345, if the 1234 promise resolves after 12345, it will indicate it's a
    duplicate. This patch keeps a count of the promises sent and only the
    latest promise will set the boolean to indicate if it's a duplicate.
    
    Hard to test because the promises usually resolve in order:
    1. Add a new holding with the first few characters of an unused barcode
    2. Scan the new barcode multiple times until you see the dup error
    3. Apply patch and scan the new barcode multiple times (no error)

    LP#1841089 Apply button in Patron Bill History screen is in confusing location
    
    It's possible to miss the apply button for the date range in bill history
    because it's located before the datepickers. The interface also allows
    invalid date ranges.
    
    This removes the apply button and watches the start and finish dates in the
    bill history and payment history controllers. If it's not first init and they
    are valid date objects in a valid date range, the grid refreshes with the new
    date range query. If start > finish they are set equal to each other to force
    a valid range.
    
    To test:
    
    1. Apply patch
    2. Bring up a patron with bills and payments (or add bills and payments)
    3. Under the Bills tab click History
    4. Change the date range and observe that the grid refreshes
    5. Try to set the start date past the finish date and vice versa

    LP 1827250: Fix Last Captured Hold Check for Holds Shelf
    
    When the current copy on an on shelf hold is the same as that on some
    uncaptured holds, the hold fails to appear on the hold shelf when it
    should.  This comes down to some SQL in the storage function to
    retrieve wide holds: open-ils.storage.action.live_holds.wide_hash.
    
    The intent of the new code is to check that the current hold matches
    the most recently captured hold for the copy.  However, the order by
    in the query fails to take into account holds with a NULL capture time
    on the same copy will sort before the captured holds.  This patch
    rectifies this situation by adding "NULLS LAST" to the order by.

    The date returned column in the csv file created in the opac for the patron's
    Check Out History contains the current date instead of the check-in date. This
    patch fixes that issue.
    
    To test:
    1. Turn on "Keep history of checked out items" in the patron Search and
    History Preferences in the opac, or find a patron that already has this
    option turned on.
    2. Check-in some items that the patron has checked-out.
    3. Wait a day, or if it was an existing history list immediately, go to the patron's Items Checked Out in the opac and look at the Date Returned
    column in the Check Out History list.
    4. Download the CSV file and note that the date is the current date.
    5. Apply the patch.
    6. Refresh and download the CSV file again and note that the Date Returned
    is now the checkin date.

    LP#1836963: reduce the cost of utility functions, speeding up search
    
    For large org trees, some several seconds are spent testing org visibility.
    The immediate cause is that AppUtils::get_org_tree() does not populate the
    process-local cache with a memcache-cached org tree. That only happens when
    memcache does not have a copy of the org tree. This is obviously a simple
    oversight, which is addressed by making sure any memcache return value
    is pushed into the the process local cache.
    
    Additionally, the visibility check is making heavy use of lots of
    indirection and delegation to utility code, when some slightly smarter code
    could avoid many repeated function calls.  We now supply some local
    utility code to flesh and unflesh the parent_ou field of objects in the
    org tree, allowing us to avoid using find_org() and instead just calling
    parent_ou() when walking "up" the tree.

    Refactor the auto_renewal feature so that it works like other renewal
    types: opac_renewal, sip_renewal, etc.  This refactor prevents
    desk_renewal from being set when auto_renewal is set.
    
    Deprecate the newly added open-ils.circ.renew.auto API and ensure that
    it still works as intended.  Add release note indicating the
    deprecation of this API and intent to remove it in Evergreen 3.5.
    
    Modify the AutoRenew action trigger reactor to use the plain
    open-ils.circ.renew API with the auto_renewal option set to 1.
    
    Add database update script to cleanup (i.e. set to FALSE) the
    desk_renewal field on action.circulation and action.aged_circulation
    tables where auto_renewal is TRUE.

    LP#1843637 MARC View Display Issues
    
    This fixes vertical alignment issues in the MARC View table
    by removing the deprecated valign tags and moving the inline
    CSS to the cat.css file. The text within each table cell should
    now align to the top for better readability.
