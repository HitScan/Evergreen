    LP#1759343 Fix annotate payment setting name
    
    This setting was added to the database with the 'eg.' prefix, but in
    the code it was not used.  The end effect was that the setting likely
    worked, but was not saved in the way expected.
    
    This makes the setting name in the code match the DB.

    LP#1812900: fix retention of saved defaults in holdings editor
    
    Because the $watch on the statistical category default OU filter
    in the holdings editor can fire before the form is fully initialized,
    saved defaults (i.e., the cat.copy.defaults workstation setting)
    could get overwritten with the hard-coded default value for that, er,
    set of defaults.
    
    This patch ensures that that $watch saves the defaults only when the
    value of the default stat cat OU filter has changed.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Use the holdings editor on an item. Change to the defaults
        tab and check or uncheck checkboxes such as "Use checkdigit"
        and "Print Item Labels on Save and Exit"
    [2] Refresh the page or open the holdings editor on a different item.
        Note that the settings from step #1 are not retained.
    [3] Apply the patch.
    [4] Repeat steps #1 and #2. This time, the settings should be retained.
    [5] Set the Default Filter Library in the same tab and refresh. Verify
        that the OU you chose is retained.

    LP 115706: Avoid Internal Server Errors with Hold Count Retrieval
    
    It can happen that the query to get a record's hold count can run too
    long and timeout or fail for some other reason.  When this happens,
    the user sees an Internal Server Error.  The underlying cause is the
    following Perl error:
    
    Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.22.1/OpenILS/Application/Circ/Holds.pm line
    4264.
    
    This commit rearranges the code around that line to avoid this
    particular undefined value reference error.

    LP#1642337: more tweaks to the patch series
    
    This patch makes the following changes:
    
    - ensures that the Boolean values get saved as 't' or 'f', as
      the reporter builder doesn't recognize JSON true or false in
      this context.
    - pretty-prints the current filter value in the dialog
    - removes a logging line
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Create or clone one or more report templates and add Boolean
        column filters. Change the filter value and verify that
        it displays the current value and lets you change it.
    [3] Run reports from the template(s) created in step 2 and
        verify that the reports produce the expected results.

    The dialog controller doesn't appreciate getting

    the egConfirmDialog.
    
    An <Unset> string is also added to the reporter
    strings for further use, but if there are no
    strong feelings re: using it, it can be dumped and
    a '' used in its place.

    [1] Bill a patron, then make sure that the "Convert Change to Patron
        Credit" checkbox is checked. Pay bill with more than the total
        balance. Note that the Credit Available amount in the billing
        summary does not change. Refresh the page.
    [2] Bill a patron, then use the patron credit added in step 1 to
        pay off the bill. Note that again, the Credit Available amount
        does not change.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeats steps 1 and 2. This time, the Credit
        Available field should get updated.

    LP#1440890: add vandelay_queue to the types of containers retrieved by batch edit
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Perform a batch bibliographic record import, then add the import
        queue to a new bucket.
    [2] In the web staff client, go to Cataloging | Batch Edit.

        Batch edit button.
    [5] Note that the bucket created in step 1 does _not_ appear in the

    LP1790896: Receipt Errors with invalid emails
    
    The attempt at belt-and-suspenders checking for a valid
    email for use in the has_email template field sadly
    causes the JS to trip over said suspenders if there is
    a value in the field but it doesn't contain a '@'.
    
    The raw return from "".match() (either an array or null)
    is enough to do the right thing when converted into a
    Boolean and doesn't cause the same problems.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Set up a patron record with an invalid email address,
        e.g., one that lacks the '@' character.
    [2] Check out an item the patron, then from the Items Out
        tab, print an item receipt.
    [3] Note that nothing happens and an error is logged in the
        browser console.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat step 2. This time, a receipt
        should be generated.
