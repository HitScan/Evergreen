    LP#1804038 Fix-ups for older 'clense' functions
    
    Way back when, we switched from a misspelled 'clense_ISO8601' to a
    corrected 'cleanse_ISO8601' in OpenSRF.  This function has again moved,
    and is now part of OpenILS::Utils::DateTime, and is named
    'clean_ISO8601'.  This was done as part of LP bug #1552778.
    
    However, a few stragglers of the misspelling remained, so these were
    missed when the big changeover occurred.  This hopefully catches them
    all!

    LP#1761242 Z39.50 Marc View Usability with Mobile Repsonsiveness
    
    This patch changes the size of the image in the Z39.50 Marc View from large to
    medium.  It also incorporates bootstrap's media classes to present the Marc
    record and the cover image side by side.  If there is no image the marc record
    display floats to the left of the modal. From a suggestion by Jane Sandbert, it
    also hides the book cover image on small devices.
    
    To test.
    1. Perform a search in z39.50.  An LOC title search for "Cat in the Hat"
       returms results of titles with and without images.
    2. View some of the titles in Marc View, noting the large image.
    3. Apply the patch.
    4. Perform the same search and view the results in Marc View.

    The hold shelf rewrite brought back an old behavioral bug where items deleted
    while on the hold shelf continued to show on the hold shelf list.  The most
    recent behavior was to ignore those items, which this commit does.  It also
    addresses an adjacent issue where holds may show with "Hold Shelf Delay"
    instead of "Ready For Pickup" in some cases.

    LP1755625: Multiple emails in patron editor
    
    Even though the HTML5 "email" input type allows multiple
    addresses to be separated by commas there is nothing that
    can be done to signal to Angular.js that this is ok; it
    will only ever accept a single address. This patch forces
    the type of the input tag to plain text so Angular will
    rely on any supplied regex to verify the entry.
    
    The ui.patron.edit.au.email.regex (Regex for email field on patron
    registration) library setting can be used to control whether
    one or multiple email addresses will be permitted on the
    patron registration form.
    
    To allow multiple addresses, that setting can be:
    
    ^(?:(?:\b[^@,\s]+@[^@,\s]+\.[^@.,\s]+\b)(?:,\s?(?!$)|$))*$
    
    To allow only a single address, use:
    
    ^(?:\b[^@,\s]+@[^@,\s]+\.[^@.,\s]+\b)$
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the web staff client, try to register a new patron, entering
        multiple email addresseses in the email field separated by
        commas.
    [2] Note that the email field displays as invalid and the
        record cannot be saved.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step #1, This time, the email
        field should accept multiple addresses.
    [4] Set the Regex for email field on patron registration library
        setting to the multiple-email form listed above. Reload
        the patron registration form and verify that it will
        continue to accept multiple email addresses but will not
        accept entry that doesn't look like an email address.
    [5] Set the library setting to the single-address value. Reload
        the patron registration form; this time it should accept
        a valid email address but not multiple ones.

    LP#1773479 Show Located URIs in browse
    
    Located URIs depend upon bib-level visibility, as there are no copies
    to work with.  The browse code, however, was joining in the copy
    visibility table as if it would always have at least one row per bib,
    but in the case of located URIs, it does not.
    
    Let's change it to a LEFT JOIN to allow the bib row to show up, at
    which point the existing bib visibility check can do its job.

    LP#1724348 Honor default tab from catalog search
    
    The default tab selection was not being honored from catalog searches,
    as the search had already set $scope.record_tab, and we were honoring
    that value in all cases.
    
    Instead, let's honor that value in cases where the OPAC load doesn't
    change our current record, which should only happen if we load the
    record directly to a non-opac tab, then go to the OPAC view.
    
    To test:
    1) Set any tab other than "OPAC View" as your default view in record
    details.
    2) Do a catalog search.
    3) Select a record, and notice your default view is not set.
    4) Apply patch, do the same steps, and notice the default view is now
    selected.
    
    To test regression of bug #1708951:
    1) In Firefox, load a record directly (e.g.
    /eg/opac/staff/cat/catalog/record/123).
    2) Note the default view loaded.
    3) Click "OPAC View".
    4) Note the view does not return to your default view, but stays on
    the OPAC.

    LP#1635737 Apply DST-aware timezone to context dates
    
    Do our best to enforce the rule required by OpenSRF's interval_to_seconds
    that when a context date is in use, and you care about DST awareness, you
    must set the timezone to a DST-aware value, e.g., 'America/New_York'. In
    most situations, 'local' will suffice for this, as the server is typically
    configured with a DST-aware timezone in its environment.  However, we will
    look for an org unit setting called 'lib.timezone' and use that where we
    can.  See LP#1705524 for info on that setting.

    Use the optional context for interval_to_seconds() to account for the

    shorter or longer than 24 hours during a time change event, "1 month"
    may be shorter or longer depending on which month it is currently, etc.
    
    Also, remove some timestamp munging, as that happens within
    interval_to_seconds() already.

    LP#1635737 Add optional context to interval_to_seconds
    
    Any given interval (e.g. "1 month") can be a different amount of
    seconds depending on the context (i.e. "1 month" after February 1 is
    March 1, but "1 month" after March 1 is April 1, yet March is longer
    than February).  This affects months all the time, but also can
    affect days, hours, and even seconds once you consider DST and "leap"
    times.
    
    By giving an optional context to interval_to_seconds, you can find
    the true number of seconds in, for example, "1 month", when starting
    from "February 1" (the context).

    LP#1755896: Web Client mobile menu font color contrast.
    
    When viewing the main menu in the web client in a small device or in a
    browser with a width that is resized to less than 800px the menu
    collapses and the submenu choices are difficult to read because of lack
    of contrast.  This patch adds some contrast.
    
    To test:
    1. View the web client in a browser and lessen the width until the menu
       collapses, or view it in a small device.
    2. Open some of the menu options to observe the submenus.
    3. Apply the patch.
    4. Refresh the browser and repeat steps 1-2 to view the more readable
       submenus.

    This patch ensures that the menu link can be fully disabled by
    giving the "disabled" CSS class to the anchor as well as the
    li that contains it. It also adds a CSS rule to the disabled
    class to force the cursor to not-allowed; due to a quirk, an
    anchor with "pointer-events: none" will not respect "cursor: not-allowed",
    but the containing element can have that cursor rule.

    LP#1801759: add mod_remoteip configuration to example Apache config
    
    Text taken from an OpenSRF patch added by Bill Erickson per bug 1684970.
    
    This patch adds an Apache configuration stanza that uses mod_remoteip
    to pass the user agent's IP address to the HTTP translator. It is meant
    for when Apache is being run behind a proxy such as NGINX.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Set up Evergreen with Apache and the WebSockets server running
        behind a proxy such as NGINX.
    [2] Enable mod_remoteip (e.g., sudo a2enmod remoteip).
    [3] Apply the Apache configuration change in this patch, uncommenting
        out the directives and (if necessary) updating the internal IP
        address of the proxy.
    [4] Reload Apache.
    [5] Perform an action that uses the HTTP translator, e.g., adding a
        vendor record using the Dojo interface.
    [6] Verify that the client IP logged is that of the user agent, not
        the proxy.

    Use of mod_remoteip is technically optional, since it's not

    use of proxies is common, enablig mod_remoteip just in case could
    be useful with minimal cost.
