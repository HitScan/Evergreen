    LP#1796945 Match new path_label/alias standard
    
    The old reporter used '::' as a path separator in some labels, while the
    new version uses '->' in its place.  This would normally be just a
    curiosity, except that the hashes used as join aliases are generated
    from these path labels.  The end result is that while a report can be
    cloned, if you add a field anywhere other than the top level, it
    references a join alias which does not exist, and the report breaks.
    
    Now, the method by which report templates are upgraded from v4 to v5
    does not happen all in one pass, but rather a first pass is made
    populate the interface, then the rest is done when the user saves the
    clone.  Because of this, it actually seems adequate to only fix the
    label, then allow the other steps to fill in the other bits upon saving
    of the report.
    
    Thank you to J. Boyer for helping track down the culprit.

    LP#1796945 Reporter cloning and creation fixes
    
    This commit addresses a variety of issues with the webstaff reporter
    interface, particularly cases of cloning reports created in the XUL
    client.
    
    1. The conversion process did not account for manually selected JOIN
    operations (aka nullability).  These JOINs are now honored by the
    conversion code.
    
    2. The conversion process did not account for aggregate filters.  These
    filters are now converted where present.
    
    3. The previous reporter interface attempted to intelligently apply LEFT
    and INNER JOINs by default.  The new interface applied INNER joins
    exclusively by default, leading in many cases to different results.
    This commit reinstates the previous logic.  One side effect of this
    change is that the IDL tree itself is no longer opinionated about JOIN
    type, and the default JOIN is undefined.
    
    4. The nullability selector has been expanded to allow for manual
    selection of INNER joins, as they will longer be the default in some
    cases.
    
    5. Cloned-converted reports did not retain column order.  The order is
    now preserved.
    
    6. Some templates created in the older interface could, in some cases,
    have aggregate values set as the string "undefined" rather than
    actually being undefined.  This led to converted templates failing with
    "column [xxx] must appear in the GROUP BY clause...", as they were
    incorrectly converted as aggregates.  The conversion code now accounts
    for this latent bug.

    Docs: fix uneven lengths of code delimiter blocks
    
    The lengths of the starting and ending sets of hyphens are supposed to be the
    same. Asciidoc tools like asciidoctor can be less forgiving than the original
    asciidoc processor, with less than hilarious results.
    
    It would probably make sense to try to standardize on something like 60 hyphens
    to easily flag this problem for deviations from the norm, but for now here's
    the result of running the docs through asciidoctor and manually adjusting the
    output.
