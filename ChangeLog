    LP#1785061: move the filter value munging to the template service
    
    This allows the reporter app to stay a bit more focused on
    display concerns.
    
    Here's a test plan for the patch series
    ---------------------------------------
    [1] Create a reporter template that has a filter field
        and a filter operator of "In list", "Not in list", "Between",
        or "Not between" and hard-code a value for that filter
        in the template, separating values with a comma.
    [2] Try to create a report from that template; note that it
        fails with an error.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1 and 2. This time, the
        report should succeed.
    
    Note that this fix applies only to hardcoding filter values in the
    template; it doesn't change any behavior when attempting to set
    a filter value for any of the four operators above at the point of
    creating a report.

    LP#1785061: Split filter value on comma for "in list" and the like
    
    This commit borrows directly from the XUL reporter code (see
    function __default_value_event_handler () in
    Open-ILS/web/reports/xul/template-config.js). Basically, when the filter
    value is saved, certain cases need special treatment, such as splitting
    an "in list" value on commas. This commit includes a helper function
    which does the special treatment and saves the filter value. This helper
    is called both when the value itself is changed, and when the operator
    is changed.

    Apply minimum date and an out of range flag to prevent
    selecting or inputting a past date when renewing items from
    Circulation->Renew Items or Patron->Items Out->Actions->
    Renew With Specific Due Date.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create a loan.
    [2] From the patron's Item Out page, use the Renew With
        Specific Due Date action. Note that the date widget
        will allow you to specify a due date in the past.
    [3] From the Circulation -> Renew interface, note that
        the date widget will also let you specify a due
        date in the past.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat steps #2 and #3. This time,
        a due date in the past cannot be entered, both via
        the calendar button and by direct entry in the text
        box.

    There are multiple controllers in staff/cat/volcopy/ and
    2 of them have a clearWorking() function. The template
    editor controller is referencing $scope.MultiMap[] which
    will never exist in the template editor, while the actual
    item editor controller clearWorking() does not reference
    $scope.MultiMap[], meaning that clearing multiple items
    at once would not work as expected. This branch clears

    LP1829567 Angular access key improvements
    
    1. Adds support for shift+ shortcuts.
    2. Remove duplicate key assignments made within the same context.  This
       is especially useful in the navigation bar since some commands repeat
       from different menus.
    3. Indicate in the key assignemnts help page when an assignemnt has be
       superseded by another assignment.
    4. Open the help page in large-dialog mode for more room.

    AutoFieldWidget's searchFormat (among other things) controls
    the formatting of the selected value for a drop-down, so
    this patch sets it for funds as well. This patch also tidys

    LP#1650409: improve authority_control_fields.pl's --all and --days_back processing
    
    When --all is used, the list of bibliographic records to process is now
    retrieved via a direct database query instead of using open-ils.storage,
    avoiding a potential timeout.
    
    The query used to fetch records when --days_back is used now fetches
    all records that were edited up to the specified number of days
    ago. Prior to this patch, --days_back ended up fetching records
    created on the current day and records edited on the --days_back
    day, skipping any that were updated in between.

    LP1813078 Menus are sometimes grayed out based on browser size
    
    This patch changes a media definition in css from 800px to 768px, the md column
    size for bootstrap.css.  Items in the menus font color changed when the browser
    was sized between 768px and 800px.
    
    To test.
    1. Expand the Circulation menu, and change the browser to a width between
    768px and 800px.  Notice that the menu items change to a gray color.
    2. Apply the patch, and then change the width of the browser.  Notice that
    the menu items do not change color before the menu is collapsed.

    LP#1805895 Bucket grid configuration updates do not save
    
    Some saved columns stick, but others are ignored. Issue affects eg-grid[s]
    that use the auto-fields attr to load all columns on idl-class attr. This
    is because saved columns are whitelisted against the initial column config
    before the auto fields are loaded.
    
    Patch adds $scope.handleAutoFields() to egCore.hatch.getItem. This happens
    after the eg-grid-fields transclude (no collisions) but before the saved
    columns are whitelisted. The original call remains to handle cases where
    there is no persist-key or saved config.
    
    Test:
    1. Go to Circulation->User Buckets
    2. Add the Is Deleted column to the grid
    3. Save columns and refresh (note Is Deleted is not visible)
    4. Apply patch and repeat steps 1-3 (note Is Deleted is now visible)

    LP1766982 - CSV downloads contain the string 'null' for null values.
    
    Adds a check for null and undefined in the getItemTextContent function
    in grid.js which is called by both the code to download grid data as
    CSV and for printing grids.
    
    To test
    1. Place holds on a couple of titles, one of which has no author. In the
       test data TCN 226, The Crow, has no author data.
    2. Pull up the Holds Pull List.
    3. Download Full CSV - to download the CSV file and view it in a
       spreadsheet or text editor looking specifically at the Author column.
    4. Print Full Grid - to view the data in a printout, since this function
       also affects printing.
    5. Go back to the Holds Pull List and click on one of the barcodes under
       the Current Copy column.
    6. Click on the List View.
    7. Download Full CSV - open the resulting file to inspect the
       Alert Message data.
    8. Apply patch and repeat steps 2-7.

    Before patch, try to import a file in CRLF end of line format that includes
    leading and trailing spaces, empty lines, lines of just spaces or
    barcodes with spaces.  The import will fail to load those items and will
    stop processing when it hits certain situations.
    
    After patch, try to import a file in CRLF EOL format that includes barcodes
    with trailing spaces, leading spaces, barcodes with spaces, and/or
    empty lines.  The import will load all barcodes.

    LP1683385 AngJS grid avoid dupe auto-fields
    
    When generating grid fields from an IDL class in the AngJS grid, avoid
    adding any fields that match fields already defined in the markup.
    
    An example of such a grid is the Pending Item Buckets page.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Go to Item Buckets and add an item to the Pending Items page.
    [2] Note that in the column picker there are two barcode fields,
        one that hyperlinks the item and one that does not.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-2.
    [4] This time, there is only one barcode column (the one that
        hyperlinks the results).

    LP#1796903: (follow-up) disabled the calendar button when the text input is disabled
    
    Disabling the calendar button when the datepicker is disabled allows
    ChromeVox (at least) to skip past a button that cannot be invoked
    until (like is possible in the checkout page) the picker is enabled.

    To test:
    
    1) After applying this commit, navigate to a place in the Web client
    that includes a date picker (such as the checkin screen).
    2) Hover over the calendar button with your mouse and confirm that a
    tooltip appears.
    3) Verify that the button element has an aria-label attribute.
    4) Verify that the button element has an aria-pressed attribute that
    is false when the date picker is closed; true when it is open.
    5) Use a screen reader (like NVDA or ChromeVox).  Verify that when you
    tab over to the date picker, the user is informed of the aria-label
    and aria-pressed values

    LP1837067: Fixing unsubscribed Observable in Replace Barcodes dialog
    
    To test:
    1) In the experimental Angular staff catalog, open up a bib record.
    2) Open the Holdings View tab.
    3) Select several items.
    4) Use the Actions for Selected Rows menu to Replace Barcodes
    5) Change the first barcode to something recognizable. Click the
    Replace Barcode button.
    6) Note that the dialog opens again to ask you to replace the
    barcode you just added.
    7) Apply this patch.
    8) Repeat steps 1-5.
    9) Note that the dialog opens again to ask you to replace the next
    barcode.
    
    Also removes some unused imports, and consolidates two RxJS pipes that
    were next to one another.
    
    Bill's Additions:
    
    Removes an unnecessary throwError which was called every time the dialog
    completed.
    
    NOTE: the source of the bug was that the Observable returned by
    pcrud.search(...) was never subscribed-to, so it never fired.  Calling
    .toPromise() forces the observable to execute.

    It both makes sense and would be useful to have a secondary decorative

    LP#1823367 De-encapsulate holdings grid styles to fix row highlighting
    
    By default, Angular will encapsulate CSS styles at the component level,
    applying them only to the component who loads them.  The encapsulation
    is helpful in some circumstances, a burden in others, and can be worked
    around in at least two ways.
    
    One way is the use of ':host /deep/' in the style declaration.  This
    will in effect apply the style to all child components of the current
    component's host, and is what we were doing here to style the grid rows
    internal to the holdings component.  This worked, but the encapsulated
    style is created in such a way that it overrides any global styles. In
    addition, /deep/ is deprecated (although with no clear replacement).
    
    A second way to work around CSS encapsulation is to simply disable it.
    Right now, our grid styles are all at the global level, as encapsulation
    is disabled in the grid.  Combined with the facts above, the end result
    is that our new row styles always trump the grid highlight style, and
    the rows no longer highlight.
    
    There are a number of ways to work around this, but none seemed
    obviously better than the others at this stage of development.  This
    commit does both the simplest option and the one which matches the
    existing grid practice.  That is, it disables CSS encapsulation for the
    holdings component so that the holdings styles can coexist with, and be
    overridden by, the grid styles (as needed in this case).

    LP#1823367 Tone down org unit row coloring
    
    Some of the text was a little hard to see, and the overall effect of
    the many colors, while attractive, was also a little distracting. In
    addition, the lighter blue colors were not obviously different from
    our standard selected-row-highlight blue.
    
    This commit tries a different direction, using some mild green shades
    based on the standard Evergreen green color base.  They are easy to
    read and still accomplish the overall goal of bringing out the org
    units (a little) and the call numbers (a little more).

    LP#1777207: teach egGrid how to prepend rows more efficiently
    
    The checkin and checkout grids in the AngularJS client have
    been doing full grid refreshes when adding a checkin or
    checkout to their respective grids. While this does not
    result in re-fetching data for the loans that were already
    processed, as more entries get added to the grid the time
    it takes to do a full digest of the grid contents during a
    egGrid.collect() (which empties the list of displayed rows,
    then refills it), gets progressively longer. Grids that have
    only ~40 entries have been observed to take several seconds
    purely on the AngularJS rendering phase.
    
    This patch teaches egGrid a new prepend() method that
    takes the first element from the underlying data source and
    unshifts it onto the list of displayed grid rows, saving much
    rendering time. The prepend() method will also force the
    grid offset back to 0 if it isn't already. Note that if
    an item that would be added via prepend() might duplicate an
    existing row entry, prepend() will do a full collect() instead.
    
    If the data source has sort options set, the prepend() will
    remove them. For arrayNotifier-based data sources, as are used
    in the checkin and checkout grids, this means that if the user
    sorts the contents of the grid, then does a circ transaction,
    the new transaction will still appear at the top of the list.
    Due to the way arrayNotifier currently works, the remaining
    entries will retain their previous ordering.
    
    As an implementation note, prepend() is likely going to work
    /only/ for arrayNotifier grid data sources.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the checkin grid, check in a large number of items.
        Note that the time it takes to each each item gets
        progressively longer.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the time
        for each checkin should not significantly vary.
    [3] Verify that column sorting works as expected.
    [4] Upon sorting the grid, do more checkins and note that
        the new transactions show up at the top.
    [5] Verify that the checkout grid continues to behave as expected.

    LP#1777207: have eg-grid generate DOM nodes only for visible columns
    
    This patch changes an ng-show to an ng-if to generate DOM nodes
    for grid cells only for visible columns. Prior to this patch, all
    grid cells were generated, but the ones that corresponded to hidden
    columns would simply be set as hidden.
    
    By not generating the cells unless they're meant to be visible, grid
    refreshes for wide grids (like the checkin table) render much more
    quickly for a couple reasons:
    
    - simply that there are fewer DOM nodes to process
    - probably more importantly, fewer AngularJS watches get
      created
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the checkin grid, check in a large number of items, then
        observe/profile timing as you change the number of visible rows.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the grid
        refreshe should be measurably (and visibly) faster.
    [3] Test other AngularJS grids and verify that grid display and
        grid actions are normal.
