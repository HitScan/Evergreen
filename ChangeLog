    Lp 1801163: Switch to Email::MIME in SendEmail A/T Reactor
    
    Switch from Email::Simple to Email::MIME Perl module in the SendEmail
    Action/Trigger Reactor.  Email::MIME properly encodes unescaped header
    fields when added to the message with the header_str_set method.
    
    We allow only 1 of each address field to be created while doing the
    encoding, so that messages conform to RFC 2822.
    
    This commit adds a new prerequisite as mentioned in the release notes,
    so be sure to install the prerequisites for your Linux distribution
    before installing.
    
    You can test this with concerto data from a fresh installation by:
    
    1. Configuring your test system to send email.
    
    2. Updating all actor.usr entries to have your email address.
    
    3. Updating the New User Created Welcome Notice event definiton to
       active = true.
    
    4. Run the action_trigger_runner with --process-hooks --run-pending.
    
    5. You should get 237 new user welcome emails.  The exact number is
       subject to change.

    To test:
    
    1) Apply this commit.
    2) Log in as a user with COPY_DELETE_WARNING.override permission.
    3) Go to item status and scan an item in a non-ideal status (like #1:
    checked out)
    4) Delete the item.  Note that you are alerted of the item's non-ideal
    status, and you can confirm that you actually want to delete it.
    5) Repeat steps 3-4 with an item in an ideal status (like #0:
    Available). Note that no such alert appears.
    6) Open the holdings view and repeat steps 4-5.
    7) Log in as a user without the COPY_DELETE_WARNING.override
    permission. Note that you are still informed about the non-ideal status,
    but you aren't able to continue with the deletion without an admin
    using their credentials.

    LP#1860351: fix hasWorkPermHere() in Angular client
    
    Fixes a bug where the Angular client's hasWorkPermHere() check
    could return incorrect results and thus incorrectly report
    whether or not the staff user currently has particularl permissions
    at their current workstation.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Arrange for a workstation whose internal ID is larger than
        any of the org unit IDs.
    [2] Log in to that workstation with a user who has permission
        to update monograph parts.
    [4] In the experimental Angular staff catalog, go to a record
        (e.g., /eg2/en-US/staff/catalog/record/21/monoparts) and note
        that the New Monograph Part button is disabled.
    [5] Apply the patch and repeat step 4. This time, the button
        should be active.

    arbitrary context in addition to the row, a GridCellTextGenerator
    that needs that additional context to have the print content match
    the displayed content may require that the caller stick it in the

    Allow grid callers to implement functions that return plain text
    (printable) values for a given cell.  These are primarily useful when a

    is ideal for printing. Such functions are specified by the cellPrintValue
    attribute in the eg-grid-column element.
    
    Includes sample implementation for the Angular record detail copies
    grid, which uses several cellTemplate cells.

    LP#1843599: AngularJS MARC editor once again sets bib source
    
    This patch fixes a regression introduced by the patch for bug 1693580
    that prevent changes to the bib source from being made via the AngularJS
    MARC editor.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Create a new bib record and save it with a non-empty source. Verify
        that the record sets the source as expected.
    [3] Edit a bib record and change the source. Verify that the new source
        is retained when the record is saved.
    [4] Edit an authority record and save it. Verify that it can be updated
        without error. (Note that authority records do not have sources in
        the same way that bib records do.)

    LP#1855329: Hold shelf query speed problem
    
    In bug 1827250 I suggested Jason Stephenson look at an alternate SQL
    formulation to solve the original problem. He did, and deemed it faster,
    so went with that. Unfortunately, on PG 9.6, we're seeing some data sets
    that decide on a /very/ poor plan for the wide-hold query with the
    solution as implemented, but the original suggestion from Jason works
    fine.
    
    In the face of evidence controverting my thought that giving PG more
    options for planning is better in this case, this commit moves to his
    original query change.

        - Server Admin -> Weights Association (circ weights and hold

        - Local Admin -> Item Tags (copy tag type)
        - Acq Admin -> EDI Accounts (provider)

    Move more of the IDL link class selector extraction logic into the IDL

    Avoid using 'name' as a fall-through selector field when no 'name' field
    exists on the class.
    
    Teach the idl service to log warnings on invalid class and field name
    combinations in selector lookups.
    
    Modify fm-editor and combobox to use the new idl link selector
    functions.
    
    While we're in there, avoid unnecessary API calls from the combobox
    by preventing async data lookups with a search term of "_CLICK_".

    LP#1857156: handle HHH:MM:SS durations in loans
    
    This patch fixes a problem where loan durations of the form
    HHH:MM:SS, where the hours component is longer than 2 digits, could
    cause checkouts to fail. This sort of duration has been observed
    in cases where a library wanted a long-term reserves loan that
    doesn't have the due time bumped up to midnight.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Set up a circulation policy that has a loan duration of 167:59:59.
    [2] Attempt a checkout that uses that policy. Note that the checkout
        will fail.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 2. This time, the checkout should
        succeed.

    LP#1855931: (follow-up) make grid filter control cells wrap as well
    
    This patch applies "word-wrap: normal" to filter control cells
    as well, making it more likely that they will stay aligned with
    the width of their corresponding header cells. This can be tested
    by adding visible columns to the "Grid with filtering" table in
    the Angular sandbox (/eg2/en-US/staff/sandbox) and verifying that
    the column after "Circulating Library" continues to have its
    filter widget stay aligned with its label.

    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the Angular

    lp1827942: prevent clicking outside an Angular modal from closing it
    
    I added a new property to the "options" object inside the "open"
    function, which resides in the dialog.component.ts. The static string
    inside the backdrop property makes the form stay, even if the backdrop
    is clicked.

    LP1607922: Receiving items on page 2 of search results
    
    Previously, if a user selected a bunch of line items on two consecutive
    pages of acq search results, and tried to receive items from the second
    page, the operation would fail.
    
    This issue was caused by Evergreen caching IDs of selected line items
    from page 1, but not caching the data that went along with them.
    
    To test:
    
    1) Go to Acquisitions > General Search
    2) In the Select Search Field dropdown, choose LI - State.
    3) Set the state to on-order.
    4) Click Search.
    5) Click the check mark to select all results on the first page.
    6) Click the Next button.
    7) Click the check mark to select all results on the second page.
    8) On the top --Actions-- menu, select Mark Selected Line Items as
    Received.
    9) Note that the interface does nothing, and that there is a TypeError
    error message in the browser console.
    10) Apply this commit.
    11) Refresh your page completely and repeat steps 1-8.
    12) Note that the items on the second page are received.  Since they no
    longer meet the search criteria, Evergreen gives you the next page of
    results.
    
    For further testing, see similar test steps by John Yorio at
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1607922.

    LP#1851524: fix adding a bucket when saving a new carousel
    
    This patch fixes a regression where saving a new carousel
    would not result in its bucket being created due to the
    post-save callback never getting invoked.
    
    This patch does not fix any carousels that do not have
    buckets due to this bug. Because such carousels will
    not function anyway, they should be deleted and
    recreated by the local admin.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create a new carousel in local adminstration. Open it
        in the edit modal again and note that no record bucket
        is linked to it.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the
        bucket should be created.
