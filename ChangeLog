    LP#1785061: move the filter value munging to the template service
    
    This allows the reporter app to stay a bit more focused on
    display concerns.
    
    Here's a test plan for the patch series
    ---------------------------------------
    [1] Create a reporter template that has a filter field
        and a filter operator of "In list", "Not in list", "Between",
        or "Not between" and hard-code a value for that filter
        in the template, separating values with a comma.
    [2] Try to create a report from that template; note that it
        fails with an error.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1 and 2. This time, the
        report should succeed.
    
    Note that this fix applies only to hardcoding filter values in the
    template; it doesn't change any behavior when attempting to set
    a filter value for any of the four operators above at the point of
    creating a report.

    LP#1785061: Split filter value on comma for "in list" and the like
    
    This commit borrows directly from the XUL reporter code (see
    function __default_value_event_handler () in
    Open-ILS/web/reports/xul/template-config.js). Basically, when the filter
    value is saved, certain cases need special treatment, such as splitting
    an "in list" value on commas. This commit includes a helper function
    which does the special treatment and saves the filter value. This helper
    is called both when the value itself is changed, and when the operator
    is changed.

    Apply minimum date and an out of range flag to prevent

    Circulation->Renew Items or Patron->Items Out->Actions->
    Renew With Specific Due Date.

    [1] Create a loan.
    [2] From the patron's Item Out page, use the Renew With
        Specific Due Date action. Note that the date widget
        will allow you to specify a due date in the past.
    [3] From the Circulation -> Renew interface, note that
        the date widget will also let you specify a due
        date in the past.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat steps #2 and #3. This time,
        a due date in the past cannot be entered, both via
        the calendar button and by direct entry in the text
        box.

    When --all is used, the list of bibliographic records to process is now
    retrieved via a direct database query instead of using open-ils.storage,
    avoiding a potential timeout.
    
    The query used to fetch records when --days_back is used now fetches
    all records that were edited up to the specified number of days
    ago. Prior to this patch, --days_back ended up fetching records
    created on the current day and records edited on the --days_back
    day, skipping any that were updated in between.

    To test.
    1. Expand the Circulation menu, and change the browser to a width between
    768px and 800px.  Notice that the menu items change to a gray color.
    2. Apply the patch, and then change the width of the browser.  Notice that
    the menu items do not change color before the menu is collapsed.

    LP#1805895 Bucket grid configuration updates do not save
    
    Some saved columns stick, but others are ignored. Issue affects eg-grid[s]
    that use the auto-fields attr to load all columns on idl-class attr. This
    is because saved columns are whitelisted against the initial column config
    before the auto fields are loaded.
    
    Patch adds $scope.handleAutoFields() to egCore.hatch.getItem. This happens
    after the eg-grid-fields transclude (no collisions) but before the saved
    columns are whitelisted. The original call remains to handle cases where
    there is no persist-key or saved config.
    
    Test:
    1. Go to Circulation->User Buckets
    2. Add the Is Deleted column to the grid
    3. Save columns and refresh (note Is Deleted is not visible)
    4. Apply patch and repeat steps 1-3 (note Is Deleted is now visible)

    Adds a check for null and undefined in the getItemTextContent function
    in grid.js which is called by both the code to download grid data as
    CSV and for printing grids.
    
    To test
    1. Place holds on a couple of titles, one of which has no author. In the
       test data TCN 226, The Crow, has no author data.
    2. Pull up the Holds Pull List.
    3. Download Full CSV - to download the CSV file and view it in a
       spreadsheet or text editor looking specifically at the Author column.
    4. Print Full Grid - to view the data in a printout, since this function
       also affects printing.
    5. Go back to the Holds Pull List and click on one of the barcodes under
       the Current Copy column.
    6. Click on the List View.
    7. Download Full CSV - open the resulting file to inspect the
       Alert Message data.

    with trailing spaces, leading spaces, barcodes with spaces, and/or
    empty lines.  The import will load all barcodes.

    To test:
    
    1) After applying this commit, navigate to a place in the Web client
    that includes a date picker (such as the checkin screen).
    2) Hover over the calendar button with your mouse and confirm that a
    tooltip appears.
    3) Verify that the button element has an aria-label attribute.
    4) Verify that the button element has an aria-pressed attribute that
    is false when the date picker is closed; true when it is open.
    5) Use a screen reader (like NVDA or ChromeVox).  Verify that when you

    LP#1777207: teach egGrid how to prepend rows more efficiently
    
    The checkin and checkout grids in the AngularJS client have
    been doing full grid refreshes when adding a checkin or
    checkout to their respective grids. While this does not
    result in re-fetching data for the loans that were already
    processed, as more entries get added to the grid the time
    it takes to do a full digest of the grid contents during a
    egGrid.collect() (which empties the list of displayed rows,
    then refills it), gets progressively longer. Grids that have
    only ~40 entries have been observed to take several seconds
    purely on the AngularJS rendering phase.
    
    This patch teaches egGrid a new prepend() method that
    takes the first element from the underlying data source and
    unshifts it onto the list of displayed grid rows, saving much
    rendering time. The prepend() method will also force the
    grid offset back to 0 if it isn't already. Note that if
    an item that would be added via prepend() might duplicate an
    existing row entry, prepend() will do a full collect() instead.
    
    If the data source has sort options set, the prepend() will
    remove them. For arrayNotifier-based data sources, as are used
    in the checkin and checkout grids, this means that if the user
    sorts the contents of the grid, then does a circ transaction,
    the new transaction will still appear at the top of the list.
    Due to the way arrayNotifier currently works, the remaining
    entries will retain their previous ordering.
    
    As an implementation note, prepend() is likely going to work
    /only/ for arrayNotifier grid data sources.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the checkin grid, check in a large number of items.
        Note that the time it takes to each each item gets
        progressively longer.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the time
        for each checkin should not significantly vary.
    [3] Verify that column sorting works as expected.
    [4] Upon sorting the grid, do more checkins and note that
        the new transactions show up at the top.
    [5] Verify that the checkout grid continues to behave as expected.

    LP#1777207: have eg-grid generate DOM nodes only for visible columns
    
    This patch changes an ng-show to an ng-if to generate DOM nodes
    for grid cells only for visible columns. Prior to this patch, all
    grid cells were generated, but the ones that corresponded to hidden
    columns would simply be set as hidden.
    
    By not generating the cells unless they're meant to be visible, grid
    refreshes for wide grids (like the checkin table) render much more
    quickly for a couple reasons:
    
    - simply that there are fewer DOM nodes to process
    - probably more importantly, fewer AngularJS watches get
      created
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the checkin grid, check in a large number of items, then
        observe/profile timing as you change the number of visible rows.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the grid
        refreshe should be measurably (and visibly) faster.
    [3] Test other AngularJS grids and verify that grid display and
        grid actions are normal.
